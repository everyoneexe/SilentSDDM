> Bugs are expected. SDDM itself has some [annoying issues](https://github.com/uiriansan/SilentSDDM/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3Asddm-issue) and limitations that make it very hard to create an actual good theme. If you encounter a bug, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/uiriansan/SilentSDDM/issues/new/choose). <br/><br/>
> **This theme is very resource-intensive. Use at your own risk.**

> You can also get the compressed files from the [latest release](https://github.com/uiriansan/SilentSDDM/releases/latest).

### 3. Test the theme to make sure you have all dependencies:
```bash
./test.sh
```

### 4. Copy the theme to `/usr/share/sddm/themes/`:
```bash
cd SilentSDDM/
sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/sddm/themes/silent
sudo cp -rf . /usr/share/sddm/themes/silent/
```

### 5. Install the fonts:
```bash
sudo cp -r /usr/share/sddm/themes/silent/fonts/* /usr/share/fonts/
```

### 6. Replace the current theme and set the environment variables in `/etc/sddm.conf`:
```bash
sudoedit /etc/sddm.conf

# Make sure these options are correct:
[General]
GreeterEnvironment=QML2_IMPORT_PATH=/usr/share/sddm/themes/silent/components/,QT_IM_MODULE=qtvirtualkeyboard
InputMethod=qtvirtualkeyboard

[Theme]
Current=silent
```

# Customizing

The preset configs are located in `./configs/`. To change the active config, edit the `./metadata.desktop` file and replace the value of `ConfigFile=`:

```bash
ConfigFile=configs/<your_preferred_config>.conf
```

> [!NOTE]
> Changes to the login screen will only take effect when made in `/usr/share/sddm/themes/silent/`. If you've changed things in the cloned directory, copy them with `sudo cp -rf SilentSDDM/. /usr/share/sddm/themes/silent/`

<br/>

You can also create your own config file. There's a guide with the list of available options (there are 200 of them xD) in the [wiki](https://github.com/uiriansan/SilentSDDM/wiki/Customizing).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't forget to test the theme after every change by running `./test.sh`, otherwise you might end up with a broken login screen.
